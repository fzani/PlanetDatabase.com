#Summary
PlanetDatabase.com is an (imaginary) service which provides information about
the eight planets of the solar system. For this project it will just display the names
of the planets and their distance from the Sun.
#Non Goals
This version will not support any functionality outside of this spec. No need to
show any more planet information other than the list of planets, and their distance
from the sun.
#Homepage
User opens the homepage and is presented with some intro text and the list of
planets. The planet list is populated by an API call to retrieve the planet list.
